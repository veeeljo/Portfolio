Dear,
I am currently in the process of waiting for graduation of the topic "Visual identity of the mobile application for getting to know and discover Belgrade".
It is an application whose functionality, design and corporate identity were made by myself. <br>I would like to join your intership so that I can further improve in
segments of work I have already learned and learn much more that the collage itself does not teach students. In a couple of years, I see myself  as a complete
graphic designer with a certain unique style and way of design. I am aware that the path to that goal is long and difficult, but I am ready for all the challenges
that life prepares. If you consider me suitable for an internship in your company, please contact me. <br>
Thanks in advance, Veljko.
